Install and run Docker Desktop on Mac

Double-click Docker.app in the Applications folder to start Docker.

The Docker menu (whale menu) displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement window.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

Docker Desktop is free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.
Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.
The Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.
Select Accept to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.

Note that Docker Desktop will not run if you do not agree to the terms. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.

For more information, see Docker Desktop Subscription Service Agreement. We recommend that you also read the FAQs.
